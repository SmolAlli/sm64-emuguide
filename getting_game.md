# Acquiring the game

While not strictly related to setting up the emulator itself, this gets asked fairly often, so it needs to be mentioned.  You will have to acquire the game ROM **on your own**. I am unable to provide help as distribution of those is illegal. 

Below are some checksums of known good files, which you can use to verify the validity of your ROMs. If you do not have a program to generate the checksums of your files, you can instead use the [Usamune ROM](https://sites.google.com/view/supermario64/usamunepj/usamunerom) patcher, which will also validate the file before applying a patch.

!!!
Keep in mind that **.n64** or **.v64** files will have **different checksums** than **.z64** files, as those have different [endianness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness).
!!!

| filename | checksum | 
|-|-|
| Super Mario 64 (U) [!].z64 | MD5: `20b854b239203baf6c961b850a4a51a2` <br>SHA1: `9bef1128717f958171a4afac3ed78ee2bb4e86ce` | 
| Super Mario 64 (J) [!].z64 | MD5: `85d61f5525af708c9f1e84dce6dc10e9` <br>SHA1: `8a20a5c83d6ceb0f0506cfc9fa20d8f438cafe51` | 

## Getting the practice ROM

After getting Super Mario 64, it's a good idea to acquire the **Usamune ROM** as well. Aside from being **an excellent practice and learning tool**, it provides a numerical input display feature which will be helpful in determining the optimal range setting for generic adapters and non-N64 controllers later on. More detailed information and instructions can be found on the project's website below.

For convenience, an online version of the patcher can be found below. Click on **Choose file** and select your **unmodified Super Mario 64** file, then select an appropriate version of the patch (**Practice US** or **Practice VC** for American version, or **Practice JP** for the Japanese version of the game).
