# glN64 0.4.1

![](./img/gln64.png)

An older plugin that still works great for Super Mario 64, while having lower requirements. Use this if you have an older PC and GLideN64 doesnâ€™t work for you. Make sure to check Enabled Dithered Alpha Testing to fix the dissolve effect (appearing during warps or with Vanish Cap).
