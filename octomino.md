# Octomino's SDL Input

A simple plugin based on the SDL2 library. Has plug and play support for controllers such as Xbox, PS4/5, Switch Pro and many others through the provided [controller database](https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB). Plug and play, no configuration needed.

While the original project hasn't been updated in a while, there's a fork which provides rudimentary configuration support.
