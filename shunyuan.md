# shunyuan’s HLE audio plugin v1.8.2u1

Another good audio plugin, however it has higher latency than Azimer and doesn’t allow going above the FPS limit.

!!!danger

This plugin is NOT recommended for speedrun usage.

The plugin still unlimits FPS during the load screens, giving an unfair advantage when **Frame Limiter** is disabled. This is very easy to do even by complete accident, and will cause the run to be **INVALIDATED**.
