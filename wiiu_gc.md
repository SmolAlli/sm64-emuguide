# Wii U/Switch Gamecube adapter setup

Unlike Yuzu or Dolphin, there is no native support for the Wii U adapter for Project64. It's necessary to install drivers which will make the adapter act like a standard DirectInput controller.

!!!warning
There have been reports of the drivers having problems with some third party adapters. If you don't have the official Nintendo adapter or the Mayflash adapter, proceed with caution.
