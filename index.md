# Comprehensive emulator setup guide for Super Mario 64 speedruns

This document describes in detail how to set up an emulator for Super Mario 64 speedrunning, while achieving the best experience possible. The guide is meant to improve upon [GiBoss' emulator setup guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k02cyFMU2de1moy1NOUjX9M79I5N7tLEty7pSpenloE/edit?usp=sharing) by providing more detailed and up-to-date information, as well as being presented in a more concise way.

!!!

This guide is meant for **Super Mario 64 speedrunning** specifically, as other speedgames may have different rulesets and require different configurations. If you want to play N64 games casually instead, there's a [page on Emulation General Wiki](https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/Nintendo_64_emulators) which may provide useful information.
